# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

This is the first project using React.

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

There are a few modals that can open when you click some buttons.
Signup and Signin modal where you enter the information (email, password, name and avatar link).
Adding new clothes item modal and entering clothe image link and name.
Image preview modal where you can see image, information about the image and also have the ability to delete this image if you created it.
And also you can update your personal information.
